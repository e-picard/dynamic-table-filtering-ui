# Multi-Table Search/Filter

A tool that allows for filtering of rows in multiple tables.

Logic exists (but is barely available through the UI) for first-order logic on value and row filters.

I ran out of time while implementing the UI, so I bought Claude Pro.
It did a pretty poor job. 5/10 - would not buy again.

Everything in the lib folder is written entirely by me.
It's pretty barebones (ie. range filters don't have exclusive boundaries), but a framework for adding more filters is there.

# How to run
```bash
  npm i
  npm run dev
```
